# This is an project that creates an application to examine information about used cars listed for sale. We have a data viewer to look at all of the information in general. Then we have a histogram that lists the vehicles by year and manufacturer. Then a scatterplot that shows price vs how long the vehicle has been listed. Finally, we have a scatterplot that shows prices by manufacturer with a checkbox to select transmission type.
